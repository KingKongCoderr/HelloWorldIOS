//Difference between Fucntion vs Methods: https://stackoverflow.com/a/24136184/3805770
//functions are available globally and not tied to a type where as methods are functions that are tied to a type or instance of an object.

//optionals

// optional = a variable can have a value or be nil
var jobDescriptionOfPerson: String?


//forced unwrapping an optional is telling the compiler that the value won't be nil at the point of usage which might cause crash at use site if its nil (more like double bangs in kotlin)
jobDescriptionOfPerson!

//implicitly unwrapping optionals
//https://krakendev.io/blog/when-to-use-implicitly-unwrapped-optionals
//https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-are-implicitly-unwrapped-optionals

//Optional binding
//the if block gets executed only if the assignment is possible and assignment is possible only if the value is not nil
if let tmpConstant = jobDescriptionOfPerson{
    //use your optional assigned to temporary constant here
    print(tmpConstant)
}

//Guard statements: The variable is scoped in parent's context
//A guard statement is used to transfer program control out of a scope if one or more conditions arenâ€™t met.

//To sum up their main intention in two words: EARLY EXIT


guard let variableName = optionalVariable else {
   return fromFunction //Early exit
}

//Closure / closures :
//similar to higher order functions in Koltin and most of the rules apply like
//rules
//1. if the last parameter of a function takes in function type then we can use closure
//2. As there is type inference we don't need to declare them
//3. first parameter can be grabbed by using $0 , and second parameter with $1 ... and so on
//4. if there is only one expression in the closure the return statement can be omitted.
